# CS673-project-team-2
This project will combine cutting-edge web technologies such as 
Three.js, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to create an engaging and interactive 
platform for Rubik's Cube enthusiasts. The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly 
and intuitive web interface that guides users through the process of solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube 
step by step. The interface will leverage the power of Three.js for 3D cube visualization, React for 
dynamic web components, and Python for solving algorithms.
