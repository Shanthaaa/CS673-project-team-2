## Overview

Our project combines cutting-edge web technologies, including Three.js, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, to create an engaging and interactive platform for Rubik's Cube enthusiasts. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive web interface that guides users through the process of solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube step by step. The interface leverages Three.js for 3D cube visualisation, React for dynamic web components, and Python for solving algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Utilizes Three.js for an immersive 3D representation of the Rubik's Cube.
- **Step-by-Step Solver:** Guides users through the solving process with Python-based algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React for a dynamic and intuitive web experience.

## Technologies Used

- Three.js
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python

## Features

- **Rotation:** User can rotate the Rubik's Cube in six directions: left, right, up, down, clockwise and counterclockwise.
- **Customize Rubik's Cube:** User can customise the state/exterior of the Rubik's Cube by selecting and setting colours to specific squares.
- **Random Scramble:** Randomly scramble the Rubik's Cube for the user so the user can play it immediately.
- **Reset:** Uncover the Rubik's Cube at once.
- **Hint:** Provide the steps of the most efficient way to uncover the Rubik's Cube, and the Rubik's Cube can rotated automatically following the steps.
- **Save:** Save the current state of the Rubik's Cube for later playing.
